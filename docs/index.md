# Cat-Scan User Manual

## The problem in one picture

![QPS Funnel](assets/qps-funnel.svg)

Google sends your bidder a torrent of bid requests. Every second, tens of
thousands of queries pour out of the Authorized Buyers exchange toward your
endpoint. Your bidder evaluates each one, decides whether to bid, and responds,
all within a few milliseconds.

Most of that traffic is noise. A typical seat ingesting 50,000 QPS might find
that only 10,000 of those queries are actually usable. There are a few
reasons: the media buyer only wants inventory up to a certain price, or only
has creatives for a specific set of ad sizes. Your bidder still has to
receive, parse, and reject each one. That costs bandwidth, compute, and money.

It also costs opportunity. While your bidder is sorting out the 40,000
irrelevant bid requests per second, Google is not sending you more of what you
would likely buy. Google already does a lot on their end to reduce waste.
Cat-Scan tries to improve on that.

It shows you where the waste happens (which geos, which publishers, which ad
sizes, which creatives) and gives you the controls to stop it at the source,
using the pretargeting configurations that Google provides.

### Why this is harder than it sounds

Google Authorized Buyers gives you only **10 pretargeting configurations per
seat**, plus coarse geographic buckets (Eastern US, Western US, Europe, Asia).
There is no Reporting API. All performance data comes from CSV exports that
arrive by email. The AB pretargeting UI itself is functional but makes it
difficult to see the full picture across configs, or to undo a change that
went wrong.

Cat-Scan closes these gaps:

- It **rebuilds reporting from CSV exports** (manual upload or automatic Gmail
  ingestion), deduplicating on import so re-processing never double-counts.
- It shows the **full RTB funnel**, from raw QPS through bids, wins,
  impressions, clicks, and spend, broken down by any dimension: geography,
  publisher, ad size, creative, config.
- It provides **safe pretargeting management** with history, staged changes,
  dry-run preview, and one-click rollback.
- It runs an **optimizer** that scores segments and proposes config changes,
  with workflow guardrails (safe / balanced / aggressive) so no change goes
  live without review.

### Who this manual is for

This manual has two tracks because Cat-Scan serves two very different roles:

**Media buyers and campaign managers** use Cat-Scan to understand where their
budget goes, find waste, manage creatives, tune pretargeting, and approve
optimization proposals. They think in CPM, win rates, and ROAS. Their chapters
focus on what the UI shows, what the numbers mean, and what actions to take.

**DevOps and platform engineers** use Cat-Scan to deploy, monitor, and
troubleshoot the system. They think in containers, health endpoints, and query
plans. Their chapters focus on architecture, deployment pipelines, database
operations, and incident runbooks.

Both tracks share a common foundation (getting started, glossary) and the
chapters cross-reference each other where workflows overlap. A media buyer
reporting "data freshness is broken" and a DevOps engineer debugging the query
behind it should be able to point to the same glossary entry and understand
each other.

## How to read this manual

- **Part 0** is for everyone. Start here.
- **Part I** is the media buyer track. If you work in campaigns, optimization,
  or buying, this is your path.
- **Part II** is the DevOps track. If you deploy, monitor, or administer
  Cat-Scan, this is your path.
- **Part III** is shared reference: glossary, FAQ, and API index.

You don't need to read linearly. Each chapter is self-contained. Follow the
links that match your role.

## Table of Contents

### Part 0: Getting Started

Everyone reads this.

- [Chapter 0: What is Cat-Scan?](00-what-is-cat-scan.md)
  What the platform does, who it is for, and the core concepts you need before
  anything else: seats, QPS, pretargeting, the RTB funnel.

- [Chapter 1: Login Errors](01-logging-in.md)
  Diagnosing authentication failures: redirect loops, 502/503 errors, session
  expiry, permission issues. The redirect-loop problem in detail.

- [Setting Up CSV Reports](02-setting-up-csv-reports.md)
  Create the five reports Cat-Scan needs. Complete metrics reference with
  every dimension and measure explained.

### Part I: Media Buyer Track

For media buyers, campaign managers, and optimization engineers.

- [Chapter 3: Understanding Your QPS Funnel](03-qps-funnel.md)
  The home page. How to read the funnel breakdown: impressions, bids, wins,
  spend, win rate, CTR, CPM. What "waste" means in concrete terms. Config
  cards and what their fields control.

- [Chapter 4: Analyzing Waste by Dimension](04-analyzing-waste.md)
  The three waste analysis views and when to use each:
  - **Geographic** (`/qps/geo`): which countries and cities eat QPS without
    converting.
  - **Publisher** (`/qps/publisher`): which domains and apps are
    underperforming.
  - **Size** (`/qps/size`): which ad sizes receive traffic but have no
    matching creatives. Google sends ~400 different sizes; most are irrelevant
    to fixed-size display ads.

- [Chapter 5: Managing Creatives](05-managing-creatives.md)
  The creative gallery (`/creatives`): browsing by format, filtering by
  performance tier, searching by ID. Thumbnails, format badges, destination
  diagnostics. Campaign clustering (`/campaigns`): drag-and-drop, AI
  auto-clustering, the unassigned pool.

- [Chapter 6: Pretargeting Configuration](06-pretargeting.md)
  What a pretargeting config controls (geos, sizes, formats, platforms, max
  QPS). How to read a config card. Applying changes with dry-run preview. The
  change history timeline (`/history`). Rollback: how it works, why it exists,
  and when to use it.

- [Chapter 7: The Optimizer (BYOM)](07-optimizer.md)
  Bring Your Own Model: registering an external scoring endpoint, validating
  it, activating it. The score-propose-approve-apply lifecycle. Workflow
  presets: safe, balanced, aggressive. Economics: effective CPM, hosting cost
  baseline, efficiency summary. What a proposal looks like and how to evaluate
  one.

- [Chapter 8: Conversions and Attribution](08-conversions.md)
  Connecting a conversion source. Pixel integration. Webhook setup: HMAC
  signatures, shared secrets, rate limiting. Readiness checks. Ingestion stats.
  What "conversion health" means and how to read the security status page.

- [Chapter 9: Data Import](09-data-import.md)
  How data gets into Cat-Scan, and why this matters. Manual CSV upload
  (`/import`): drag-drop, column mapping, validation, chunked upload for large
  files. Gmail auto-import: how it works, how to check status, what happens
  when it fails. The data freshness grid: what "imported" vs "missing" means
  per date and report type. Deduplication guarantees.

- [Chapter 10: Reading Your Reports](10-reading-reports.md)
  Spend stats, config performance panels, endpoint efficiency metrics. How to
  interpret trends. What the daily breakdown shows. Snapshot comparisons:
  before and after a pretargeting change.

### Part II: DevOps Track

For platform engineers, SREs, and system administrators.

- [Admin Navigation](02-navigating-the-dashboard.md)
  Sidebar layout, restricted users, setup checklist, language support.

- [Chapter 11: Architecture Overview](11-architecture.md)
  System topology: FastAPI backend, Next.js 14 frontend, Postgres (Cloud SQL),
  BigQuery. Why both databases exist (cost, latency, pre-aggregation,
  connection handling). Container layout: api, dashboard, oauth2-proxy,
  cloudsql-proxy, nginx. The auth trust chain: OAuth2 Proxy sets `<AUTH_HEADER>`,
  nginx passes it, API trusts it.

- [Chapter 12: Deployment](12-deployment.md)
  CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions `build-and-push.yml` builds images on push;
  `deploy.yml` is manual-trigger only (with `DEPLOY` confirmation). Artifact
  Registry image tags (`sha-XXXXXXX`). The deploy sequence: git pull on VM,
  docker compose pull, recreate, prune. Post-deploy verification: health check,
  contract check. Why auto-deploy is disabled (Jan 2026 incident). How to
  verify a deploy: `curl /api/health | jq .git_sha`.

- [Chapter 13: Health Monitoring and Diagnostics](13-health-monitoring.md)
  Health endpoints: `/api/health` (liveness), `/system/data-health` (data
  completeness). The System Status page (`/settings/system`): Python, Node,
  FFmpeg, database, disk, thumbnails. Runtime health scripts:
  `diagnose_v1_buyer_report_coverage.sh`,
  `run_v1_runtime_health_strict_dispatch.sh`. Canary authentication:
  `CATSCAN_CANARY_EMAIL`, `CATSCAN_BEARER_TOKEN`. CI workflows:
  `v1-runtime-health-strict.yml` and what PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED mean.

- [Chapter 14: Database Operations](14-database.md)
  Postgres-only production. Cloud SQL via proxy container. Key tables and their
  scale: `rtb_daily` (~84M rows), `rtb_bidstream` (~21M rows), `rtb_quality`,
  `rtb_bid_filtering`. Critical indexes: `(buyer_account_id, metric_date
  DESC)`. Connection model: per-request (no pool), `run_in_executor` for async.
  Statement timeouts (`SET LOCAL statement_timeout`). Data retention settings.
  BigQuery's role: batch warehouse for raw data; Postgres serves pre-aggregated
  data to the app.

- [Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Runbook](15-troubleshooting.md)
  Known failure patterns and how to resolve them:
  - **Login loop**: Cloud SQL Proxy down, `_get_or_create_oauth2_user` fails
    silently, `/auth/check` returns `{authenticated:false}`, frontend redirect
    loop. Three-layer fix. How to detect: redirect counter in browser, 503
    from `/auth/check`.
  - **Data-freshness timeout**: Large tables doing seq scans instead of using
    indexes. Symptoms: `/uploads/data-freshness` times out or returns 500.
    Diagnosis: `pg_stat_activity`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. Fix pattern:
    generate_series + EXISTS.
  - **Gmail import failure**: `/gmail/status` shows error. Check Cloud SQL
    Proxy container. Check unread count.
  - **Container restart ordering**: `cloudsql-proxy` must be healthy before
    `api` starts. Signs of wrong order: connection refused in API logs.

- [Chapter 16: User and Permission Administration](16-user-admin.md)
  The admin panel (`/admin`): user creation (local and OAuth pre-create), role
  management, per-seat permissions. Service accounts: uploading GCP credential
  JSON, what it unlocks (seat discovery, pretargeting sync). Restricted users:
  what they see and what is hidden. The audit log: what actions are tracked,
  how to filter, retention.

- [Chapter 17: Integrations](17-integrations.md)
  GCP service accounts and project connection. Google Authorized Buyers API:
  seat discovery, pretargeting config sync, RTB endpoint sync. Gmail
  integration: OAuth2 for automatic report ingestion. Language AI providers:
  Gemini, Claude, Grok (for creative language detection and mismatch alerts).
  Conversion webhooks: endpoint registration, HMAC verification, rate limiting,
  freshness monitoring.

### Part III: Reference

Shared by both tracks.

- [Glossary](glossary.md)
  Every term in two languages. Media buyer column: "pretargeting" is "the rules
  that control which bid requests reach your bidder." DevOps column:
  "pretargeting" is "a mutable entity synced from the AB API, stored in
  `pretargeting_configs`, exposed via `/settings/pretargeting`." Both need the
  same word; neither uses the other's definition.

- [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md)
  Persona-tagged. Questions a media buyer asks ("Why is my coverage at 74%?")
  next to questions a DevOps engineer asks ("Why did the runtime health strict
  gate fail?"). Answers cross-link to the relevant chapter.

- [API Quick Reference](api-reference.md)
  All 118+ endpoints grouped by domain: core, seats, creatives, campaigns,
  analytics, settings, admin, optimizer, conversions, integrations, uploads,
  snapshots, auth. Method, path, key parameters, and what it returns. Not a
  substitute for the OpenAPI spec at `/api/docs`, but a navigable index.
